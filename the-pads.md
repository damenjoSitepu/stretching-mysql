* The Pads ( Medium )

- Generate the following two result sets:

- Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

- There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

- Query Answer: 

```
SELECT 
CONCAT(occupations.name,'(',LEFT(occupations.occupation,1),')')
FROM occupations ORDER BY occupations.name ASC;

SELECT 
CONCAT("There are a total of",' ',COUNT(occupations.occupation),' ',LOWER(occupations.occupation),'s.')
FROM occupations 
GROUP BY occupations.occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(occupations.occupation) ASC, occupations.occupation ASC;
```
