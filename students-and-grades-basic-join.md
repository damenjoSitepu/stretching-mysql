*** Students and Grades ***

- Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesnt want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use NULL as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order. Write a query to help Eve.

- Query Answer: 

```
SELECT 
CASE 
    WHEN grades.grade <= 7 THEN NULL
    ELSE students.name
END,
grades.grade,
students.marks
FROM students INNER JOIN grades 
ON (students.marks >= grades.min_mark AND students.marks <= grades.max_mark)
ORDER BY grades.grade DESC, students.name ASC;
```
